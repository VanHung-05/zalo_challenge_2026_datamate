# DataMate: Natural-Language Question Answering over Structured Data

Spreadsheets and simple databases are the most widely used data systems in the world. A shop owner keeps sales and inventory in Excel; a teacher keeps grades and attendance; a clinic keeps patient visits and medicine batches; an HR officer keeps timesheets; a cooperative keeps yields and input costs; a commune office keeps household statistics; a journalist downloads open data from the General Statistics Office; an employee of a large company wants a number from the data warehouse without waiting for the data team. All of them have the data. Almost none of them can write a query.

What they want is to ask in plain Vietnamese:

- “Tháng này bán chạy nhất mặt hàng gì?”
- “Tuần rồi bán được bao nhiêu ly trà sữa?”
- “Còn ai nợ tiền chưa trả?”
- “Thuốc nào sắp hết hạn trong kho?”

—and get a correct answer.

## Challenge

**DataMate** challenges you to build an AI agent that answers natural-language Vietnamese questions directly on structured data (CSV, Excel, SQLite). Given the raw files and a question, the agent returns a correct answer—or declines to answer when the data cannot support the question.

The competition data is anchored in the world of Vietnamese small businesses—the largest group of spreadsheet users in the country and the one with the richest, messiest real-world data—but the capability you build is general: natural-language question answering over tabular data.

## Input

Each input contains:

- **A data package** for one business: one or more files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.sqlite`) plus a short `README.md` describing the business.
- **A question** in everyday Vietnamese.
- **An as-of date**: the “today” against which relative time expressions such as “tháng này” (this month), “tuần rồi” (last week), and “cùng kỳ năm ngoái” (the same period last year) are resolved.
- **A rulebook and a solar–lunar calendar**, shared by every business in the split (see the Data section).

## Output

For each question, return a final answer of one of the types defined in the Evaluation section:

- A value: number, percent, string, date, boolean, list, or table.
- `unanswerable` when the data cannot support the question.
- `abstain` when the agent chooses not to answer.

## Example

**Input** — one line of `questions.jsonl`:

```json
{"id": "q_06de33fa21cc", "business_id": "biz_118", "question": "sp bán dc nhiều nhất tuần rồi là gì", "as_of_date": "2026-03-04"}
```

**Output** — one line of `submission.jsonl`:

```json
{"id": "q_06de33fa21cc", "type": "string", "answer": "Xi măng Hà Tiên PCB40 bao 50kg"}
```
