# Competition Rules

## Competition rounds

The competition runs on a leaderboard with two rounds:

- **Round 1 — Public test:** Teams develop their solutions, run them on the public test set and upload `submission.jsonl`. Scores appear on the public leaderboard and are for reference only during development.
- **Final solution submission:** Before the solution deadline, the final solution is submitted as a Docker image, following the organizers’ separate Docker guideline. For scoring, the organizers mount the test set into the container at `/data` and collect `/result/submission.jsonl`.
- **Round 2 — Private test:** After teams submit and freeze their solutions, the organizers release the private test set. Teams run their frozen solution on it and upload `submission.jsonl`. The final ranking is based on the organizers’ re-run of the submitted Docker images (Rule 8).

## Technical requirements

Every solution must meet all of the following requirements:

1. **Teams and eligibility.** Teams and eligibility follow the general regulations of Zalo AI Challenge 2026.

2. **Models.** You may use any model whose weights were publicly released before 1 October 2026 under a licence that permits such use, and you may fine-tune it freely. Across all models used at inference by your solution (language models, embedding models, rerankers, classifiers), whether loaded at the same time or not, the total number of parameters must not exceed **15 billion**, counting all parameters of mixture-of-experts models. Any quantization is allowed. The models used must be declared in the solution README.

3. **No external services.** Inference must run fully offline inside your Docker image: no calls to commercial LLM APIs, no downloads, and no network access of any kind. The image is run with networking disabled.

4. **No human in the loop.** Answers must be produced by your system without manual intervention. Hard-coding answers, or logic keyed on question or business identifiers, is prohibited.

5. **Code execution.** Your agent may generate and execute code inside the container; this is expected but not required. The data directory is mounted read-only; write temporary files elsewhere.

6. **Data.** You may use the provided training data, data you synthesize yourself, and publicly available datasets and models. You may not use the public or private test data for training, nor collect answers to test questions by any means.

7. **Compute reference.** Solutions are verified on a machine with **2 × NVIDIA RTX 5090** (32 GB VRAM each, 64 GB total), **512 GB RAM**. Your solution must process the entire private test set within **6 hours** of wall-clock time on this machine, including model loading. Blackwell GPUs require CUDA ≥ 12.8 and a matching PyTorch/vLLM build; the Docker guideline specifies the base image to use.

8. **Final score and reproducibility.** The score of the organizers’ re-run of your submitted Docker image on the private test set is your final score. The `submission.jsonl` you upload during the private test phase determines only the provisional leaderboard and which teams are re-run.

   Your solution must be deterministic enough that the two runs agree: a solution is considered reproducible if

   \[
   |\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{uploaded}} - \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{re-run}}| \leq 0.03
   \]

   If the difference exceeds 0.03, the organizers will examine the logs written by your image (see Submission format, Section Data), may run the image once more, and may request additional information from the team; if the difference cannot be explained, the entry is disqualified.

   If the re-run exceeds the time limit of Rule 7 or terminates early, only the answers written to `/result/submission.jsonl` before termination are scored; the rest count as `abstain`.
